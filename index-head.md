# AMWA IS-05 NMOS Device Connection Management Specification

IS-05 is an AMWA NMOS Specification for connection of networked media devices

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal IS-05 specification is provided at in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-device-connection-management). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which are specified in RAML and JSON Schema).

The links below are for the “master” branch of the repo. This is typically the same as the most recent release of the Specification. Links to other releases (tags) and other branches appear later in the page.
